I've stayed out of the Internet public for quite some time but this
constitutes my return.  I'll focus on the projects, tools, and just
fun/cool stuff I make or come across.

This comes, in some ways, as the result of a renewed interest in side
projects and a general frustration with building tools and apps just for
myself.  This blog (somehow that word just feels weird in 2015) is here
to document my journey as a new, albeit experienced, contributor to the
creative world.
