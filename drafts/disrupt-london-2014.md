I went to TechCrunch Disrupt London 2014 and was able to enter into the
hackathon.  Perhaps shockingly it was my first but with a bit
(over)confidence and good night's rest I set out to hack something
together.

The result was "ManholeCoverMap".  The name is a poor use of bad
Cockney.  (Manhole Cover => Brother => Giant conceptual leap to Big
Brother Map.)  The pitch revolves around an app that maps a route through or
around London's CCTV cameras
